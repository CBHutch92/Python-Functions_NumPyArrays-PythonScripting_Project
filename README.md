# About the Functions and NumPyArrays Project

# The code for this Functions and NumPy Arrays project was written by me as part of the course work for my Python Scripting for Data Science course (ITEC 3100).

# The comments throughout the code were for my professor and to highlight each step we were required to cover on our assignment sheet.

# I received an A for this project.
